# Homework 06

For any exercise where you’re writing code, insert a code chunk and make
sure to label the chunk. Use a short and informative label. For any
exercise where you’re creating a plot, make sure to label all axes,
legends, etc. and give it an informative title. For any exercise where
you’re including a description and/or interpretation, use full
sentences. Make a commit at least after finishing each exercise, or
better yet, more frequently. Push your work regularly to GitHub, and
make sure all checks pass.

1.  **Country populations.** For this exercise you will work with data
    on country populations. The data come from [The
    WorldBank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL). The
    dataset you will use is in your `data/` folder and it’s called
    `country-pop.csv`.

- Load the two dataset using `read_csv()`.

  - You will need to use the `skip` argument since the CSV file has some
    extraneous rows on top. First load the data without it, then
    determine how many rows to skip.
  - Make sure there are no extraneous columns by removing them.
  - Use `janitor::clean_names()`

- Find the countries with the top 10 highest population count in 2020.
  Subset the data for just these 10 countries.

- Create a racing bar chart, using **gganimate** for the change in
  population for these countries.

Use the following prompt for Questions 2-5.

**Meaning of life.** A 2021 Pew Research survey of 18,850 adults from 17
advanced economies (Canada, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the
Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, the United States,
Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan) asked
the following question: “We’re interested in exploring what it means to
live a satisfying life. What aspects of your life do you currently find
meaningful, fulfilling or satisfying?” The results of the survey are
summarized in the following visualization, which can be found on [Pew’s
summary of their
findings](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2021/11/18/what-makes-life-meaningful-views-from-17-advanced-economies/).

<img src="images/pew.png" title="While family, careers, material well-being, friends and health are all top sources of meaning, they vary in importance across publics surveyed." alt="While family, careers, material well-being, friends and health are all top sources of meaning, they vary in importance across publics surveyed." width="100%"/>

2.  **The data.** Create a dataset based on the data presented in this
    visualization. You will want to take a peek at the next question,
    since the dataset you create / how the data are organized will
    depend on the type of visualization you might make in the next
    question.

- The code to create the data should go in the `data/data-create.R`
  file.
- The dataset should be called `life_meaning` and saved as
  `life_meaning.csv` in the data folder.

3.  **The visualization.** Create an alternative visualization of these
    data. Accompany your visualization with a brief explanation of how
    you decided to create what you created, as well as how it is similar
    to and how it differs from the original visualization. It’s OK if
    your visualization is such that all the conclusions that can be
    drawn from the original visualization can’t be drawn from yours
    (e.g., maybe fewer choices per country are displayed), but this
    should be something you articulate in your answer along with a
    justification with why you think it’s OK to omit this feature. Make
    sure that your visualization employs accessibility best practices
    we’ve discussed in class, and write a sentence about features you’ve
    decided to include/omit to meet these guidelines. The code to make
    the visualization should go in your Quarto file (as usual).
4.  **The app.** Create a Shiny app that features the visualization you
    made and at least one reactive element. The reactivity can be as
    simple as selecting a country to highlight. Deploy the app to
    shinyapps.io.

- The code of the app should go in the `app1` folder.
- The link to the deployed app should be included in your R Markdown
  folder.
- If you have a dataset you’ve created and placed in the `data` folder
  in the root of your project/repo, move that data file into the
  `app1/data` folder. You need everything needed to run the app in the
  `app1` folder for deployment. This creates multiple copies of the data
  in your repo, but that’s ok. If you don’t have a dataset
- Note: You’ve learned about Shiny in class, but we haven’t covered
  deployment, so completing this question will require a bit of
  self-learning. See [this article on
  deployment](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/shinyapps.html) for
  instructions) for instructions for deployment to shinyapps.io, and ask
  questions if you need further guidance!

5.  **The styled app.** Change the look of your app using the theming
    features and the auto-theming option offered by the
    [thematic](https://rstudio.github.io/thematic) package. This will
    allow the look of your app to match the look of your visualization.
    Deploy the app to Shinyapps.io.

- The code of the app should go in the `app2` folder.
- The link to the deployed app should be included in your R Markdown
  folder.
